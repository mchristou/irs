# IP Range Scanner

A simple tool to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports.

## Usage

Run the scanner by providing the base IP address and optionally specifying the ports to check.

```
irs -b <base_ip> -p <port1,port2,...>
```

By default, the scanner checks port 80 if no ports are specified.
